# Backend configuration for storing Terraform state in S3
# Note: This file will be generated dynamically by the GitHub Actions workflow
# with environment-specific values. The naming convention is:
# - Bucket: {project_name}-terraform-state-{aws_account_id}
# - DynamoDB: {project_name}-terraform-locks
# - State Key: aws/ec2-runner/{environment}/terraform.tfstate
#
# The setup-terraform-backend.sh script will create these resources
# if they don't exist.

# This file is intentionally left minimal - it will be overwritten
# by the workflow with actual backend configuration values
